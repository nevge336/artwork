By 1912, however, he set out to prove the end of “retinal art”—pictures created to delight the eye—in order to “put painting once again at the service of the mind.” His answer was the “readymade,” an ordinary object transformed into a work of art by virtue of the artist selecting it. Taken out of context, repositioned, and signed by the artist, the readymade upended tradition and artistic convention by revolutionizing the way we think about what an artwork is, how it is produced, and the ways in which it is exhibited.</p>\n<p>In 1914 Duchamp purchased this mass-produced bottle rack at a department store. He felt free to acquire new versions for exhibitions and display after his sister accidentally discarded the “original.” He selected the present version for the 1959 exhibition <em>Art and the Found Object in New York</em>. Artist Robert Rauschenberg acquired <em>Bottle Rack</em> and asked Duchamp to sign it. He obliged, writing in French, “Impossible for me to recall the original phrase M.D. / Marcel Duchamp /1960.”</p>\n","dimensions":"Diameter at base: 59.1 × 36.8 cm (23 5/16 × 14 1/2 in.); 59.1 × 36.2 cm (23 1/4 × 14 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":36.8,"width_in":14.4882,"height_cm":59.1,"height_in":23.2678,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Diameter at base"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":36.2,"width_in":14.25,"height_cm":59.1,"height_in":23.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Galvanized iron","inscriptions":"Inscribed on inner side of bottom ring:  “Impossible de me rappeler la phrase originale M.D./ Marcel Duchamp/1960”","credit_line":"Through prior gifts of Mary and Leigh Block, Mr. and Mrs. Maurice E.

He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in <em>We Two Boys Together Clinging</em> (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.</p>\n<p>While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series <em>The Blue Guitar</em> interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print <em>Old Guitarist</em> juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps Hockney’s <em>Blue Guitar</em> that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s <em>Old Guitarist</em>. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.</p>\n","dimensions":"Plate: 42.5 × 34.5 cm (16 3/4 × 13 5/8 in.); Sheet: 52.5 × 46 cm (20 11/16 × 18 1/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":34.5,"width_in":13.5827,"height_cm":42.5,"height_in":16.7323,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Plate"},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":46,"width_in":18.1103,"height_cm":52.5,"height_in":20.6693,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Sheet"}],"medium_display":"Color etching and aquatint from two copper plates on white wove paper","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mrs. Solomon B.

Although he took his subject from modern life, Seurat sought to evoke the sense of timelessness associated with ancient art, especially Egyptian and Greek sculpture. He once wrote, “I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.”</p>\n<p>Seurat painted <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em> using pointillism, a highly systematic and scientific technique based on the hypothesis that closely positioned points of pure color mix together in the viewer’s eye. He began work on the canvas in 1884 (and included this date in the title) with a layer of small, horizontal brushstrokes in complementary colors. He next added a series of dots that coalesce into solid and luminous forms when seen from a distance. Sometime before 1889 Seurat added a border of blue, orange, and red dots that provide a visual transition between the painting’s interior and the specially designed white frame, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/articles/969/la-grande-jatte-frame-by-frame\">which has been re-created at the Art Institute</a>.</p>\n","dimensions":"207.5 × 308.1 cm (81 3/4 × 121 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":308.1,"width_in":121.25,"height_cm":207.5,"height_in":81.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed at lower right: Seurat","credit_line":"Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":"<p>de Hauke 162</p>","publication_history":"Jules Christophe, Georges Seurat (Paris, 1890).\n\nGustave Kahn, “Seurat,” L’Art Moderne 11 (April 5, 1891), pp. 107-10.\n\nHenry van de Velde, “Georges Seurat,” La Wallonie 6 (March/April 1891), pp. 167-71.\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Mort de Georges Seurat,” La Nation (April 1, 1891).\n\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Georges Seurat,” La Société nouvelle (April 30, 1891), pp. 430-38.\n\nTéodor de Wyzewa, “Georges Seurat,” L’Art dans les Deux Mondes 22 (April 18, 1891), pp. 263-64.\n\nJules Christophe, “Seurat,” La Plume (September 1, 1891).\n\nPaul Signac, D’Eugène Delacroix au néo-impressionnisme (Paris, 1899).\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Georges Seurat,” L’Art Moderne 15, 13 (April 1, 1900), p. 104.\n\nThadée Natanson, “Un Primitif d’aujourd’hui: Georges Seurat,” La Revue Blanche 21 (April 1900), pp. 610-14.\n\nEmile Verhaeren, “Notes: Georges Seurat,” La Nouvelle Revue Française 1 (February 1, 1909), p. 92.\n\nRoger Fry, “The Post-Impressionsists,” in Manet and the Post-Impressionists, exh. cat.

The real and mythical creatures on the vessel—birds, monkeys, bears, dragons, kneeling figures, and immortals riding dragons—all follow the iconography of early Chinese funerary art. Intermingled with these images, however, are depictions of the Buddha, who is identified by his meditating posture, topknot, and halo. The marginal role of Buddhist art in this decorative scheme reflects the adoption of the alien Indian religion, as the Chinese then understood it, into a hospitable mélange of different spiritual beliefs. Additionally, this jar reflects a formative stage in the development of China’s renowned celadon glaze, which became more uniform in color and texture over subsequent centuries.</p>\n","dimensions":"48.7 × 27.5 cm (19 3/16 × 10 13/16 in.); Diam.: 27.5 cm (10 13/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":48.7,"height_in":19.1875,"diameter_cm":27.5,"diameter_in":10.8125,"clarification":null},{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":0,"width_in":0,"height_cm":0,"height_in":0,"diameter_cm":27.5,"diameter_in":10.8125,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Stoneware with olive-green glaze and molded and applied decoration","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior bequests of Mary Hooker Dole and Grace Brown Palmer; through prior gifts of Josephine P.

Here his strong, assured manner, coupled with the heroic proportions of the figures and the emphasis on the large scythe (an emblem often associated with the Soviet Union)—as well as the social realist sensibilities that prevail throughout his oeuvre, his travels to the Soviet Union, and his writings for and affiliation with left-wing publications such as <em>Masses and Mainstream, Freedomways</em>, and the <em>Daily Worker</em>—suggest that <em>Harvest Talk</em> was inspired by socialist ideals.

He relocated to Chicago in 1967 to study first sculpture, then photography, at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As a boy in Havana, Medina had, as he put it, “explored the brightest and darkest corners of that city . . . in search of ineffable essences, contradictions, and tragedies contained in anything human.” This interest in his immediate surroundings continued in Chicago, where he turned to the territorial gang graffiti he found in his own neighborhood northwest of Wrigley Field. Medina approached these images as an archivist and as someone familiar with power struggles, photographing several walls after gang members had swung cans of white paint at them to efface a rival gang’s graffiti. He eventually gained the trust of members of several Latino gangs, who allowed him to take their portraits in front of their graffiti, in a further gesture of power and defiance.</p>\n","dimensions":"Paper: 23.6 × 33.4 × 35.4 cm (9 5/16 × 13 1/8 × 13 15/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":35.4,"depth_in":13.9371,"width_cm":33.4,"width_in":13.1212,"height_cm":23.6,"height_in":9.2914,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Paper"}],"medium_display":"Silver dye-bleach print","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Luis Medina Memorial Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":20,"fiscal_year":1986,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 1979 Luis Medina.","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":20.0763,"color":{"h":5,"l":56,"s":38,"percentage":0.00198036664508067,"population":10},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Photograph","artwork_type_id":2,"department_title":"Photography and Media","department_id":"PC-12","artist_id":35721,"artist_title":"Luis Medina","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[35721],"artist_titles":["Luis Medina"],"category_ids":["PC-12"],"category_titles":["Photography and Media"],"term_titles":["silver-dye bleach print","Chicago","photography","photographic process","photography","photograph","latinX","photograph","photographic images","photographic materials","photographic print"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-812","classification_title":"silver-dye bleach print","alt_classification_ids":["TM-68","TM-67","TM-240"],"classification_ids":["TM-812","TM-68","TM-67","TM-240"],"classification_titles":["silver-dye bleach print","photographic process","photography","photograph"],"subject_id":"TM-12075","alt_subject_ids":["TM-14471"],"subject_ids":["TM-12075","TM-14471"],"subject_titles":["Chicago","latinX"],"material_id":"TM-14147","alt_material_ids":["TM-13858","TM-13158","TM-3250","TM-13906"],"material_ids":["TM-14147","TM-13858","TM-13158","TM-3250","TM-13906"],"material_titles":["photography","photograph","photographic images","photographic materials","photographic print"],"technique_id":null,"alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":[],"technique_titles":[],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"141be63b-de6e-c8a3-e8a2-8801df16586e","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["1986.174"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Untitled"],"weight":1,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2022-09-21T19:19:07-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-02T23:33:27-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-03T10:29:02-06:00"},{"id":63279,"api_model":"artworks","api_link":"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/63279","is_boosted":false,"title":"Grand Avenue, Chicago","alt_titles":null,"thumbnail":{"lqip":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBgAFAPQAAExMTVBQUVdYWF1cXV1dXV5eXmFhYWVlZWxsbW1ubm9wcHFxcXJxcXJycnR0dHh4eHt7e319fX9/f4GAgIKCgYuLi5mZmK2sq7KxsLq5uNPT0d/g3fDv7fv7+AAAAAAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAGAAUAAAUY4IVpW8cRAVNl1jMcAjBJRqMUDpVAEbKEADs=","width":3000,"height":2370,"alt_text":"A work made of gelatin silver print."},"main_reference_number":"1981.567","has_not_been_viewed_much":true,"boost_rank":null,"date_start":1969,"date_end":1969,"date_display":"1969","date_qualifier_title":"Made","date_qualifier_id":4,"artist_display":"José Lopez (American, born Cuba, 1941–1991) and\nLuis Medina (American, born Cuba, 1942–1985)","place_of_origin":"United States","description":null,"dimensions":"Image/paper: 17.8 × 22.7 cm (7 1/16 × 8 15/16 in.);

In Elizabeth “Elsie” Swinton’s case, he accentuated her regal bearing and feminine dress. Sargent harmonized the realism of her face and body with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing the shimmering, translucent fabric descending from her shoulder. Swinton was also known for her musical talents; at the time her portrait was executed, she was recognized as an amateur singer and later began performing professionally.</p>\n","dimensions":"231 × 124 cm (90 3/4 × 48 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":124,"width_in":48.75,"height_cm":231,"height_in":90.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, lower left: \"John S.

Contrary to stereotypical representations of African Americans common during the postwar era, White consistently depicted his subjects as strong and proud. An immensely talented draftsman, White wanted others to be conscious of the pride he had in his people, and he believed that art was the most appropriate tool for relaying this message to the public. White focused on African American women during the 1950s and throughout his career, even devoting a solo exhibition in New York to the subject. For this show White created pieces that honored the strength of black women including works such as <em>Harriet Tubman</em> (1949; private collection) and <em>Mother</em> (1945; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). When asked about the exhibition, White explained the the African American woman deserves “a great deal more recognition for the never-ending sacrifices she has made and the continuing leadership she has given in the struggles of the Negro people for full equality.”</p>\n<p>During this time, White created <em>Portrait of a Woman</em>, 1950, which shows a contemporary working-class African American woman. The subject’s large eyes are inviting and warm, but the noticeable bags, along with her wrinkled face, imply that her life has been hard. Plainly clothed with simply styled hair and no jewelry, she is obviously a commoner, but White’s depiction suggests that although she may not be conventionally beautiful or important, she still has her dignity. Furthermore, her striking doleful eyes address the viewer directly in a tender gaze.<br>Increasingly leftist in his political views, White’s admiration for the working classes is visible in his murals, his paintings, and his works on paper.  White chose to focus not only on inequalities and degradation experienced by African Americans, but also the humanity and beauty he saw in them. White’s <em>Portrait of a Woman</em> celebrates his subject by portraying her as valuable and worthy of not only his artistic representation, but also of our respect.

Each of the corners of the box and lid is painted with a network of violet and gold ornaments characteristic of the factory’s mature, late-Baroque style.

By the 1970s she began to insert meticulous trompe l’oeil elements as well, including metal rulers and masking tape painted along the borders of her images. The artist has explained that the painted rulers measured or marked the physical dimensions of a work’s edge, while the painted floors measured or marked illusionistic space. In Mangold’s words, “The works of this period were like catalogues of these different realities in painting.”</p>\n<p>In their constant reappraisal of the relationship between painting and picture, and in their frequent recourse to the grid-like structures of flooring, Mangold’s works can operate like rigorous abstractions, aligned with Minimal and Conceptual practices of the time. Yet they often derive their affect from more subjective, even personal content as well. For instance, the ruler in this painting, which stops on the right edge of the canvas at 66 ¾ inches, serves as an intimate tribute, corresponding to the age of the artist’s father at his death. This is the only work in her oeuvre that offers such an overtly biographical, memorializing reference. The green linoleum floor, which is also exclusive to this work, was inspired by a small section of old flooring the artist discovered in her basement. Here Mangold painted, with her customary precision, an imagined reconstruction as opposed to an observed reality.</p>\n","dimensions":"76.5 × 183 cm (30 × 72 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":183,"width_in":72,"height_cm":76.5,"height_in":30,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Through prior gift of Adeline Yates","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2009,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Sylvia Plimack Mangold.","has_multimedia_resources":true,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":23.1148,"color":{"h":107,"l":57,"s":17,"percentage":2.18998083766767,"population":6480},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":61535,"artist_title":"Sylvia Plimack Mangold","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[61535],"artist_titles":["Sylvia Plimack Mangold"],"category_ids":["PC-825","PC-8"],"category_titles":["Women artists","Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["painting (image making)","acrylic paint","grids","acrylic paintings (visual works)","canvas","squares","green (color)","rulers (people)","painting"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-10368","classification_title":"acrylic paintings (visual works)","alt_classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_ids":["TM-10368","TM-9"],"classification_titles":["acrylic paintings (visual works)","painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12518","alt_subject_ids":["TM-12654","TM-11849","TM-12865"],"subject_ids":["TM-12518","TM-12654","TM-11849","TM-12865"],"subject_titles":["grids","squares","green (color)","rulers (people)"],"material_id":"TM-2407","alt_material_ids":["TM-3124"],"material_ids":["TM-2407","TM-3124"],"material_titles":["acrylic paint","canvas"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":["Women artists"],"image_id":"a947ecd5-93aa-93d4-4a4d-3aca15a30857","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":["986ce7ec-ce39-fd71-2ea4-ee29920f1a28"],"sound_ids":["986ce7ec-ce39-fd71-2ea4-ee29920f1a28"],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"In Memory of My Father","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2009.52"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["In Memory of My Father"],"weight":2434,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2022-12-06T11:34:52-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-02T23:33:19-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-03T10:29:03-06:00"},{"id":198809,"api_model":"artworks","api_link":"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/198809","is_boosted":true,"title":"Self-Portrait of My Sister","alt_titles":null,"thumbnail":{"lqip":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBAAFAPQAABskHh85NSFAMihCOS1JOT9NSzReUT5iZl1VSUBWVklfX1FZUk5lW0ZjZ1RjY1ZsZF9taFdzdmt6d2V9gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAEAAUAAAURYNQcyuQsiQQhxWMEA0MAQggAOw==","width":4344,"height":5360,"alt_text":"A work made of oil on canvas."},"main_reference_number":"2009.59","has_not_been_viewed_much":false,"boost_rank":null,"date_start":1941,"date_end":1941,"date_display":"1941","date_qualifier_title":"","date_qualifier_id":null,"artist_display":"Gertrude Abercrombie (American, 1909–1977)","place_of_origin":"United States","description":"<p>At first glance, <em>Self-Portrait of My Sister</em> appears to be a relatively straightforward representation of a young woman. It was painted by the Chicago Surrealist Gertrude Abercrombie but seems to lack the mysterious imagery of her landscapes and interior scenes. Further examination, however, reveals subtle touches of her dark aesthetic, beginning with the title itself. <em>Self-Portrait of My Sister</em> is an enigmatic reference to a sister who did not exist, for the artist was in fact an only child. However, Abercrombie initially referred to this painting as “Portrait of Artist as Ideal,” a phrase that reveals her underlying meaning. Abercrombie’s work was invariably self-referential; as she put it, “It’s always myself that I paint, but not actually, because I don’t look that good or cute.” Her reference to a fictitious, prettier sister hints at her desire to be a different person, a longing she satisfied through self-portraiture.</p>\n<p>Here, the artist exaggerated and idealized her appearance, depicting herself with an extraordinarily long, slender neck; vivid blue eyes; and sharpened features. She portrayed herself wearing black gloves and a flat-brimmed hat trimmed with a bunch of grapes, all motifs that recurred with some frequency in her paintings and acted as symbols of her presence. Such inclusions helped shape her individual variant of Surrealism, which she felt was based in realism. “Surrealism is meant for me,” she remarked, “because I am a pretty realistic person but don’t like all I see. So I dream that it is changed. Then I change it to the way I want it. It is almost always pretty real. Only mystery and fantasy have been added. All foolishness has been taken out. It becomes my own dream.”</p>\n","dimensions":"68.6 × 55.9 cm (27 × 22 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":55.9,"width_in":22,"height_cm":68.6,"height_in":27,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Powell and Barbara Bridges","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"<em>Annual Report</em> (Art Institute of Chicago, 2008–09), 16.\n\n<em>Paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago: Highlights of the Collection</em>, (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago/Yale University Press, 2017) 133.","exhibition_history":"Art Institute of Chicago, <em>52nd Annual Exhibition of American Paintings and Sculpture</em>, Oct. 30, 1941–Jan. 4, 1942, cat. 1.\n\nNew York, Associated American Artist Galleries, <em>First Exhibition of Paintings by Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, Jan. 24–Feb. 6, 1949, cat. 9.\n\nAthens, Ohio University, 1947.\n\nChicago Public Library, <em>Art Room</em>, 1948.\n\nChicago, Mandel Brothers Gallery, <em>Exhibition of Chicago Artists' Self Portraits</em>, 1953.\n\nChicago, Newman Brown Gallery, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, 1953.\n\nAurora, Illinois, John Fordon Gallery, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, 1953.\n\nChicago, Hyde Park Art Center, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie: a Retrospective Exhibition</em>, 1977, as <em>Self–Portrait</em>, cat. 25.\n\nChicago and Springfield, Illinois State Museum, <em>Gertrude Abercrombie</em>, 1991.\n\nChicago and Springfield, Illinois State Museum, <em>Chicago Painting, 1895–1945, the Bridges Collection</em>, 2000–01, cat. 1.\n\nChicago, Terra Museum of American Art, <em>Chicago Modern, 1893–1945: Pursuit of the New</em>, July 17–Oct. 31, 2004, cat. 1.\n\nMadison, Wisconsin, Elvehjem Museum of Art, <em>With Friends–Six Magic Realists</em>, June 18–Aug. 28, 2005.\n\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, <em>Art In Chicago – Resisting Regionalism, Transforming Modernsim</em>, Feb. 9–Apr. 2, 2006, cat. 17.\n\nSpringfield, Illinois State Museum, <em>Chicago Painting, 1895–1945, the Bridges Collection</em>, 2007–08.\n\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art, <em>In Wonderland: The Surrealist Activities of Women Artists in Mexico and the United States</em>, Jan. 29–May 6, 2012; Musee National des Beaux–Arts du Quebec, June 7–Sept. 3, 2012; Mexico City, Museo de Arte Moderno, Sept. 27, 2012–Jan. 13, 2013, cat. 24.\n\nChicago, Newberry Library, <em>Chicago Avant-Garde</em>, Sept. 10–Dec. 30, 2021, cat.

These efforts culminated in the early 1920s in the artist's breakthrough to a style of fantastic, simplified forms, freely and loosely scattered across the surface of his pictures with an exuberant abandon that is hard to imagine based on this tightly constructed portrait. And yet, something of this exuberance—of the vitality and poetic intensity of Miró‘s later works—seems indeed to underly this strangely powerful portrait, manifesting itself, for example, in the unrestrained rhythms of the dress, barely held in check by the diamond grid in the background, or in the lyrical note introduced by the small flower on the front of the dress.<br>Different and often contrasting impulses are brought here into uneasy balance through the sheer force of Miró's talent for creating compelling simplifications of the forms before him. The strong rhythms established by the dress, wallpaper, and face all vie for attention, as do the artist's various sources of inspiration: the influence of the Fauves and especially of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35809\"> Henri Matisse</a> in the bold use of color, dense application of paint, and flat patterning of the dress and background; the effect of Cubism in the far more sculptural, angular treatment of the face; and the impact of the Romanesque frescoes of Miró's native Catalonia (which the artist himself acknowledged as a major inspiration) in the linear rhythms of the dress, hair, and background, in the frontal pose, and in the large, staring eyes. This is a painting of dramatic contrasts, between the insistent flatness of the dress and back-ground and the Cubist modeling of the face, between the startling pink of the wallpaper and the restrained black-and-white color scheme of the dress, between the human presence of the sitter and the strong linear patterns that threaten to engulf it. It does not seem surprising, given the impact this portrait still has today, that the young woman who initially agreed to sit for it became frightened both by Miró's intensity and his strange style of painting, forcing him to finish the portrait from memory.</p>\n<p>—Entry,  Margherita Andreotti, <em>Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies</em>, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 152-153.</p>\n","dimensions":"69.5 × 62 cm (27 3/8 × 24 3/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":62,"width_in":24.375,"height_cm":69.5,"height_in":27.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed and dated lower left:  Miro/1918","credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Joseph Fontales Ráfols, \"Miró antes de ‘La Masia’\" Anales y boletín de los museos de arte de Barcelona, vol. 6, no. 3–4 (July-December 1948): 497–502, ill. n.p.  \n\nJacques Revert and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, Joan Miró (Paris, 1956), ill. opp. p. 109.\n\n\"Accessions of American and Canadian Museums,\" Art Quarterly XX (Autumn 1957), p. 326 (ill.), fig. 3.\n\nEduard Hüttinger, Miró (Bern, 1957), pp. 10–11, fig. 5.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago (Chicago, 1961), pp. 314, 430 (ill.).\n\nJacques Dupin, Joan Miró: Life and Work, trans.

Modeled by Edward Kemeys, an essentially self-taught artist and the nation’s first great animalier (sculptor of animals), the lion pair was unveiled on May 10, 1894. Kemeys focused his talents on sculptural portrayals of North American wildlife, capturing such native creatures in anatomical, naturalistic detail. For the Art Institute, he modeled larger-than-life African lions, the one positioned north of the steps “on the prowl” and the lion to the south <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/656\">“in an attitude of defiance,”</a> (1893.1a) in Kemeys’s words.

The site became the museum’s permanent home at the conclusion of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, where the new structure had hosted lectures and other events for fairgoers. Modeled by Edward Kemeys, an essentially self-taught artist and the nation’s first great animalier (sculptor of animals), the lion pair was unveiled on May 10, 1894. Kemeys focused his talents on sculptural portrayals of North American wildlife, capturing such native creatures in anatomical, naturalistic detail.

Several of the dukes enriched the beauty of the house. For example, the 4th Duke commissioned a suite of chinoiserie furniture from the fashionable London cabinet makers John and William Linnell in 1754, which became famous enough to influence future projects. Similarly, the 4th Duke’s son, who became the 5th Duke of Beaufort in 1756 when he was only twelve years old, wasted no time in making additions of his own to Badminton when he reached his majority. In his account books for 1782 appears the following entry: “February 23 to Wm France Library Ladder 16 Pounds 11s.” The reference is to the London cabinetmaker William France, Jr., whose father had set up a significant cabinetmaking shop next door to Thomas Chippendale’s in St. Martin’s Lane in the 1760s.</p>\n<p>As a graduate of Oxford with a doctorate in civil law, the 5th Duke lavished much attention on the library at Badminton, including this library ladder.

Their artistic experiments, often undertaken in the spirit of friendly competition, challenged hierarchical distinctions between fine art, grounded in aesthetics, and decorative art, associated with functionality. Bernard carved the left panel and possibly the bottom panel. Both artists incorporated animals, trees, and people from village life in Brittany, France, motifs they also used in their paintings. The figures on the right panel were inspired by Gauguin’s trip the previous year to the Caribbean island of Martinique.

He participated in nearly one dozen invitational exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1942 to 1957 and received three awards of distinction. His career was capped by the museum’s 1951 purchase of one of his most extraordinary pieces, <em>Man of Sorrows</em>. This sculpture is indeed powerful, but its emotional intensity is not achieved through brute force of carving or any “primitivizing” influence.  Rather, it succeeds through its brilliant balance of exaggeration and restraint. Its sheer physical presence is conveyed through the impressive bulk of the marble block—often scavenged from abandoned buildings. The head’s simplified, protruding eyes are shut tight; the pursed lips are both hidden and defined by a short stubby beard; the hair is veined with smoothly carved thorns. Christ’s contained expression of agony is arresting.</p>\n","dimensions":"44.4 × 25.4 × 25.4 cm (17 1/2 × 10 × 10 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":25.4,"depth_in":10,"width_cm":25.4,"width_in":10,"height_cm":44.4,"height_in":17.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Marble","inscriptions":"Inscription: signed and dated on back, chiseled into stone: \"MP 50\"","credit_line":"Pauline Palmer Prize Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"C.

Depicted here is the most frequently represented episode from the popular legend of Saint George, in which the model Christian knight saves a town and rescues a beautiful princess. Conceived in the elegant, decorative International Gothic style, the painting was originally the center of an altarpiece dedicated to Saint George that was apparently made for the chapel of the palace of the Catalan government in Barcelona. This central scene was surrounded by four smaller narrative panels, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and was probably surmounted by a lost image of Christ on the Cross. Here Saint George, on his white steed, triumphs over the evil dragon. A wealth of precisely observed details intensifies the drama. Dressed in an ermine-lined robe, the princess wears a sumptuous gilt crown atop her wavy red-gold hair. Her parents and their subjects watch the spectacle from the distant town walls. George’s halo and armor and the scaly body of the dragon are richly modeled with raised stucco decoration. Martorell also treated the ground, littered with bones and crawling with lizards, in a lively manner, giving it a gritty texture.</p>\n","dimensions":"155.6 × 98.1 cm (61 1/4 × 38 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":98.1,"width_in":38.625,"height_cm":155.6,"height_in":61.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Tempera on panel","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Mrs. Richard E.

Kjartansson & The National\nIcelandic, born 1976","place_of_origin":null,"description":"<p>Icelandic artist and musician Ragnar Kjartansson’s often intensely durational performance-based works manifest a rare synthesis of pathos and humor. <em>A Lot of Sorrow</em> is both a music video and an extended concert film, in which Brooklyn-based band The National performs its three-and-a-half minute ballad <em>Sorrow</em> on repeat, for six hours. The band’s music and lyrics frequently conjure notions of romantic suffering and melancholy—themes common to Kjartansson’s own emotive, theatrical work.<br>As the hours pass and fatigue sets in, the musicians subtly alter their song; the original track is always recognizable but is also treated as elastic and expressive rather than rigid. Kjartansson sometimes appears in the role of a roadie, offering water and food to the performers throughout the concert. Multiple camera angles grant the viewer access to both the perspective of the musicians and that of the audience, as the band and the crowd feed off each other’s energy with every repetition.</p>\n","dimensions":null,"dimensions_detail":[],"medium_display":"Single channel high-definition color video (projection) with sound, 6:09:35 loop; Edition number eight of ten with two artist's proofs","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Stephanie Skestos Gabriele","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2016,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":4.8026,"color":{"h":189,"l":44,"s":4,"percentage":0.100893690133948,"population":478},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Film, Video, New Media","artwork_type_id":33,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":114275,"artist_title":"Ragnar Kjartansson","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[114275],"artist_titles":["Ragnar Kjartansson"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["time-based works","21st Century","video","video art","funerary"],"style_id":"TM-12913","style_title":"21st Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-12913"],"style_titles":["21st Century"],"classification_id":"TM-12314","classification_title":"time-based works","alt_classification_ids":["TM-1706","TM-11076"],"classification_ids":["TM-12314","TM-1706","TM-11076"],"classification_titles":["time-based works","video art","funerary"],"subject_id":null,"alt_subject_ids":[],"subject_ids":[],"subject_titles":[],"material_id":"TM-12063","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-12063"],"material_titles":["video"],"technique_id":null,"alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":[],"technique_titles":[],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"1acff95e-1a94-e9c6-5974-38888e47c7f4","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2015.90"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["A Lot of Sorrow"],"weight":141,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-10-30T14:03:16-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-02T23:33:11-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-03T10:29:05-06:00"},{"id":223896,"api_model":"artworks","api_link":"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/223896","is_boosted":false,"title":"The Invisible Man (Harlem, New York), from the series \"A Man Becomes Invisible\" (1952)","alt_titles":null,"thumbnail":{"lqip":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBgAFAPQAAConJURAPklFQktGQ05KR1pWUVpWUmZhXm5pZXVwaX12bYuGf5eSjJmUjZyWj6GZjaKblKSfmK2mnaymn7evpb21q7q0rL+4r8G4rsG6s8K6s8S9tcnBudTMxAAAAAAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAGAAUAAAUYYHVx28RgXaZZEXUAQVMoA2EgwiNBzpKEADs=","width":6506,"height":5114,"alt_text":"A work made of gelatin silver print."},"main_reference_number":"2014.1101","has_not_been_viewed_much":false,"boost_rank":null,"date_start":1952,"date_end":1952,"date_display":"1952","date_qualifier_title":"Made","date_qualifier_id":4,"artist_display":"Gordon Parks\nAmerican, 1912–2006","place_of_origin":"United States","description":"<p>I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. . . . When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything except me.<br>—Ralph Ellison, <em>Invisible Man</em>, 1952</p>\n<p>By 1952 <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/20027/gordon-parks\">Gordon Parks</a> had cemented his reputation as a successful photojournalist by becoming the first African American staff photographer at <em>Life</em> magazine. Ralph Ellison had just published his first and only finished novel, <em>Invisible Man</em>, regarded today as one of the most important American novels of the postwar period. That same year, these two artists and friends undertook the second of two magazine collaborations: a photo-essay for the August 25, 1952, issue of <em>Life</em> that introduced Ellison’s novel and titled “A Man Becomes Invisible.” These collaborations aimed to bring to national consciousness the black experience in postwar America, with Harlem as its nerve center.</p>\n<p>Written in the first person, <em>Invisible Man</em> recounts the journey of an unnamed black protagonist from the Deep South to Harlem. It is also a stark account of America’s racial divisions and of the narrator’s awakening to his condition of invisibility within the surrounding cultures of white and black alike—a realization that no one can see beyond what is projected onto the color of his skin.</p>\n<p>Within months of the novel’s publication, Parks and Ellison collaborated on “A Man Becomes Invisible”—although the level of Ellison’s involvement remains unclear. Parks set out to create photographs that illustrate Ellison’s text, depicting many of the novel’s key Harlem scenes: the protagonist’s brightly lit underground home, his rousing street speeches, the climactic accounts of the Harlem riots, and the iconic portrayal of the protagonist ending his hibernation and emerging aboveground. The resulting images are strikingly varied, including street photography, staged images shot in elaborately constructed sets, and surreal photomontages. They hew to Ellison’s prose style, which collapses distinctions between realism and fantasy. But the depictions are true not just to Ellison’s words but also to the emotions underlying them. Only four of these photographs were ever published in <em>Life</em>, but the dozens of surviving prints and contact sheets in Parks’s archive point to a larger, unrealized project.</p>\n","dimensions":"Image/paper/frame: 33.1 × 42 cm (13 1/16 × 16 9/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":42,"width_in":16.5355,"height_cm":33.1,"height_in":13.0315,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":"Image/paper/frame"}],"medium_display":"Gelatin silver print","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Anonymous gift","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":20,"fiscal_year":2015,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":843,"copyright_notice":null,"has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":8.0009,"color":{"h":8,"l":5,"s":23,"percentage":0.04544568078166571,"population":254},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":false,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":null,"gallery_id":null,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Photograph","artwork_type_id":2,"department_title":"Photography and Media","department_id":"PC-12","artist_id":20027,"artist_title":"Gordon Parks","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[20027],"artist_titles":["Gordon Parks"],"category_ids":["PC-12","PC-830","PC-142"],"category_titles":["Photography and Media","African Diaspora","African American artists"],"term_titles":["photographic paper","photography","black-and-white photography","20th Century","civil rights","photograph","photographic processes","photographic techniques","photography","photographic process"],"style_id":"TM-13130","style_title":"20th Century","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-13130"],"style_titles":["20th Century"],"classification_id":"TM-67","classification_title":"photography","alt_classification_ids":["TM-240","TM-68"],"classification_ids":["TM-67","TM-240","TM-68"],"classification_titles":["photography","photograph","photographic process"],"subject_id":"TM-13480","alt_subject_ids":[],"subject_ids":["TM-13480"],"subject_titles":["civil rights"],"material_id":"TM-3046","alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":["TM-3046"],"material_titles":["photographic paper"],"technique_id":"TM-12089","alt_technique_ids":["TM-3937","TM-3977","TM-3978"],"technique_ids":["TM-12089","TM-3937","TM-3977","TM-3978"],"technique_titles":["black-and-white photography","photographic processes","photographic techniques","photography"],"theme_titles":["African American artists","African Diaspora"],"image_id":"5faa9094-1f8c-14f0-67b9-4c429d9a32df","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2014.1101"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["The Invisible Man (Harlem, New York), from the series \"A Man Becomes Invisible\" (1952)"],"weight":832,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-09-15T11:01:49-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-02T23:33:11-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-03T10:29:05-06:00"},{"id":111659,"api_model":"artworks","api_link":"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/111659","is_boosted":false,"title":"Abraham Lincoln","alt_titles":null,"thumbnail":{"lqip":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBAAFAPQAAC8tLjAuLzQyMmBeXmdlZWxra3Bvb39+foSDgpSTkpmYmKGhoKKiob6/vsfHxs/Pztrb2uLj4u7v7gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAEAAUAAAURYAQ9kmMMDQMERCIEhXIgSwgAOw==","width":6857,"height":8482,"alt_text":"A work made of bronze."},"main_reference_number":"1991.324","has_not_been_viewed_much":false,"boost_rank":null,"date_start":1916,"date_end":1916,"date_display":"Modeled 1916, cast after 1916","date_qualifier_title":"Modeled","date_qualifier_id":50,"artist_display":"Daniel Chester French (American, 1850–1931)","place_of_origin":"United States","description":"<p>Lorado Taft praised Daniel Chester French as “the dean of American sculptors.” French specialized in large-scale marble statues, private memorials, and portrait busts.

His eye is of a dangerous fixedness; . . . [and] the instant his lips close, a visor of steel would scarcely look more impenetrable.” William Rush rendered a remarkably similar depiction of the general. Demonstrating a blend of naturalism, subtlety, and strength, Rush avoided grandiosity in this terra-cotta portrait bust of the fifty-two-year-old military hero, who, ten years later, would begin to serve the first of two consecutive terms as president of the United States. The artist’s only concession to idealization was the replacement of the general’s well-known stiff, wiry hair with the soft curls that signify noble qualities in Neoclassical sculpture. Since there is no documentation that Jackson formally posed for Rush, the artist, a prominent resident of Philadelphia, may have observed the general during his three-day visit to the city in 1819. This sculpture achieved critical and commercial success, with one reviewer ranking it as “Rush’s masterpiece.” Hoping to benefit from Jackson’s popularity, Rush followed the European custom of producing plaster replicas of the bust.</p>\n","dimensions":"50.5 × 47.9 × 22.2 cm (19 7/8 × 18 7/8 × 8 3/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":22.2,"depth_in":8.75,"width_cm":47.9,"width_in":18.875,"height_cm":50.5,"height_in":19.875,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Terracotta","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Purchased with funds provided by Jamee J. and Marshall Field, the Brooks and Hope B.

She married the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz in 1924, and the following year they moved into the Shelton, a recently completed skyscraper. O’Keeffe was fascinated by the soaring height of the building and emphasized its majesty in this painting by rendering it from the street below. In the glaring light of the emerging sun, the building becomes an abstracted series of rectangles arranged in the center of the composition. Yet the hard edges of the Shelton are softened by the numerous circular sunspots and wavy, flowing lines of smoke and steam, suggesting that despite her urban subject matter, O’Keeffe nevertheless sought to unify man-made and organic forms, just as she would in her southwestern paintings such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46327\"><em>Black Cross, New Mexico </em></a>.</p>\n","dimensions":"122.6 × 76.9 cm (48 1/4 × 30 1/4 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":76.9,"width_in":30.25,"height_cm":122.6,"height_in":48.25,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, titled, and dated on label on reverse","credit_line":"Gift of Leigh B.

He began using images of Elizabeth Taylor in early 1962. Her beauty and allure fueled interest in the sordid tragedies of her personal life, which included failed marriages, love affairs, and a near-death experience that occurred while filming <em>Cleopatra</em> (1963). <em>Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz]</em> comes from a series of thirteen canvases, each with the same image of Taylor set before a jewel-toned background. Warhol used a preexisting publicity still of Taylor as his source material, which he cropped and then enlarged so that the actress literally fills the screen. Her signature features — her eyes and lips — have been accentuated with colors that hover between vibrant and vulgar. This garish use of “makeup” is meant to suggest style and glamor, reinforcing Taylor’s celebrity status.</p>\n","dimensions":"101.6 × 101.6 cm (40 × 40 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":101.6,"width_in":40,"height_cm":101.6,"height_in":40,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Acrylic and silkscreen ink on linen","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Edlis Neeson Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2015,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":true,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© 2018 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":27.5545,"color":{"h":180,"l":53,"s":89,"percentage":0.0007044178268428275,"population":5},"latitude":41.8805599830586,"longitude":-87.6216788414211,"latlon":"41.880559983059,41.880559983059","is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 296","gallery_id":25472,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":37219,"artist_title":"Andy Warhol","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[37219],"artist_titles":["Andy Warhol"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["Pop Art","actresses","acrylic paint","painting (image making)","acrylic paintings (visual works)","celebrities","silkscreen print","linen (material)","painting"],"style_id":"TM-7221","style_title":"Pop Art","alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":["TM-7221"],"style_titles":["Pop Art"],"classification_id":"TM-10368","classification_title":"acrylic paintings (visual works)","alt_classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_ids":["TM-10368","TM-9"],"classification_titles":["acrylic paintings (visual works)","painting"],"subject_id":"TM-12709","alt_subject_ids":["TM-13437"],"subject_ids":["TM-12709","TM-13437"],"subject_titles":["actresses","celebrities"],"material_id":"TM-2407","alt_material_ids":["TM-13317","TM-3093"],"material_ids":["TM-2407","TM-13317","TM-3093"],"material_titles":["acrylic paint","silkscreen print","linen (material)"],"technique_id":"TM-3891","alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":["TM-3891"],"technique_titles":["painting (image making)"],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"362c0c2a-4576-2207-4ba9-2b87e6d0bad0","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_boosted":"Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz]","suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2015.160"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz]"],"weight":7811,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-02-24T15:08:25-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-02T23:33:09-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-03T10:29:05-06:00"},{"id":229351,"api_model":"artworks","api_link":"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/229351","is_boosted":true,"title":"Target","alt_titles":null,"thumbnail":{"lqip":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBQAFAPQAAHFKUn1SVH1aW35uT3B0YKMqH702Lrk+N7lANIRMSIZQT49fWoxcZZFoaYd6aJCKTI+QQ42TTpeXSpKYTomUUKGaQ5iKbJKeZqSlZwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAFAAUAAAUV4KFYjNFE1RQ42AMNyyVRCSIQQBECADs=","width":10714,"height":10665,"alt_text":"A work made of encaustic and newspaper on canvas."},"main_reference_number":"2015.119","has_not_been_viewed_much":false,"boost_rank":null,"date_start":1961,"date_end":1961,"date_display":"1961","date_qualifier_title":"Made","date_qualifier_id":4,"artist_display":"Jasper Johns\nAmerican, born 1930","place_of_origin":"United States","description":"<p>In the mid-1950s Jasper Johns was searching for a way to move beyond Abstract Expressionism. He took the radical step of destroying his previous work and began painting a set of motifs that included numbers, the American flag, and the alphabet. These instantly recognizable images allowed him to reintroduce subject matter into his work, freeing him to explore other painterly concerns. One of the found images that Johns employed was the target, and from 1955 to 1961 the artist produced several dozen paintings and drawings that explored this device.</p>\n<p>Initially, Johns chose a palette of primary colors, a preexisting schema as found as the image itself. The artist’s use of oil and encaustic (pigment mixed with hot wax) created a quick-drying medium that recorded each drag and drip of the brush in almost sculptural terms. Indeed, these gestural nods to his Abstract predecessors allowed him to investigate the subtle nuances between form and material.

Van Gogh conceived the first <em>Bedroom</em> in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green. I had wished to express utter repose with all these very different tones.” Although the picture symbolized relaxation and peace to the artist, to our eyes the canvas seems to teem with nervous energy, instability, and turmoil, an effect heightened by the sharply receding perspective.</p>\n","dimensions":"73.6 × 92.3 cm (29 × 36 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":92.3,"width_in":36.625,"height_cm":73.6,"height_in":29,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts, \"Exhibition of French Paintings from a Well-Known Collection,\" Bulletin of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 14, 4 (April 1925), 31–32.\n\nForbes Watson, \"A Note on the Birch Bartlett Collection,\" The Arts 9, no. 6 (June 1926): 303–06 (ill.), 307–13.\n\nR.M.F., “Van Gogh in Arles,” Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago 20, no. 7, (October 1926): 92–94.\n\nMuseo del Palacio de Bellas Artes, Rojo mexicano: la grana cochinilla en el arte, exh. cat.

His inimitable scribbles and scrawls are at once intuitive and sublime, casual or even crude and refined. Twombly made the dynamic, brooding <em>Untitled</em> as one in a suite of fourteen large-scale paintings during the summer of 1969 while ensconced at Palazzo del Drago on the shores of Lake Bolsena in central Italy. Against a rich, creamy ground, he elaborated on the cascades of planar and tubular shapes that had emerged in his painting the year before, using diagram-like forms to imbue the canvas with a sense of spatiotemporal flow, as well as a certain airiness. On the other hand, the white field—darkened here and there by passages of erasure—also takes on the aspect of a heavily revised mathematical worksheet. Twombly was immersed both in his work and in his particular location, titling these paintings with the place-name Bolsena. But while typically he might find inspiration in the history of his ancient rural retreat, in this case he was as attuned to that summer’s defining moment: the <em>Apollo II</em> moon landing. Such context enhances our reading of the painting’s enigmatic visual language of measurement, drift, and direction.</p>\n","dimensions":"199.4 × 240 cm (78 1/2 × 94 1/2 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":240,"width_in":94.5,"height_cm":199.4,"height_in":78.5,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil-based house paint, wax crayon, and graphite on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Gift of Edlis Neeson Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":null,"exhibition_history":null,"provenance_text":null,"edition":null,"publishing_verification_level":"Web Basic","internal_department_id":246,"fiscal_year":2015,"fiscal_year_deaccession":null,"is_public_domain":false,"is_zoomable":false,"max_zoom_window_size":1280,"copyright_notice":"© Cy Twombly Foundation","has_multimedia_resources":false,"has_educational_resources":false,"has_advanced_imaging":false,"colorfulness":16.9059,"color":{"h":200,"l":48,"s":4,"percentage":0.003538498867680362,"population":21},"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"latlon":null,"is_on_view":true,"on_loan_display":null,"gallery_title":"Gallery 292","gallery_id":25469,"nomisma_id":null,"artwork_type_title":"Painting","artwork_type_id":1,"department_title":"Contemporary Art","department_id":"PC-8","artist_id":37052,"artist_title":"Cy Twombly","alt_artist_ids":[],"artist_ids":[37052],"artist_titles":["Cy Twombly"],"category_ids":["PC-8"],"category_titles":["Contemporary Art"],"term_titles":["painting"],"style_id":null,"style_title":null,"alt_style_ids":[],"style_ids":[],"style_titles":[],"classification_id":"TM-9","classification_title":"painting","alt_classification_ids":[],"classification_ids":["TM-9"],"classification_titles":["painting"],"subject_id":null,"alt_subject_ids":[],"subject_ids":[],"subject_titles":[],"material_id":null,"alt_material_ids":[],"material_ids":[],"material_titles":[],"technique_id":null,"alt_technique_ids":[],"technique_ids":[],"technique_titles":[],"theme_titles":[],"image_id":"e3d04f27-7de4-653e-ce68-81a87561af5a","alt_image_ids":[],"document_ids":[],"sound_ids":[],"video_ids":[],"text_ids":[],"section_ids":[],"section_titles":[],"site_ids":[],"suggest_autocomplete_all":[{"input":["2015.139"],"contexts":{"groupings":["accession"]}},{"input":["Untitled"],"weight":2561,"contexts":{"groupings":["title"]}}],"source_updated_at":"2023-11-17T00:15:17-06:00","updated_at":"2023-12-02T23:33:08-06:00","timestamp":"2023-12-03T10:29:05-06:00"},{"id":229363,"api_model":"artworks","api_link":"https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/229363","is_boosted":false,"title":"Artist's Studio \"Foot Medication\"","alt_titles":null,"thumbnail":{"lqip":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBwAFAPUAAF99bIF7RaunXoSUhouTh7aIj6GWjLKfgb+Zn7Gxnb+dp6uporGtqrW1p6CptcCbjcKPlceugsujnNeklcmzlMukpdWjrN+6scfItdC+wdG+w7bAyNHCwOHDyuDY1OrX2O/g3uXm4+nj4QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAHAAUAAAYhQFFIAok0Np4MpTBJOAiGiuKCEQwACMtHEzgsHh0QhxEEADs=","width":5293,"height":3950,"alt_text":"A work made of oil and magna on canvas."},"main_reference_number":"2015.131","has_not_been_viewed_much":false,"boost_rank":null,"date_start":1974,"date_end":1974,"date_display":"1974","date_qualifier_title":"Made","date_qualifier_id":4,"artist_display":"Roy Lichtenstein\nAmerican, 1923–1997","place_of_origin":"United States","description":"<p>By the 1970s, Roy Lichtenstein’s comic-book style of painting had become his trademark.

Into this flattened studio space Lichtenstein similarly inserted whole or partial versions of his own real and imagined artworks across a range of subject matter, including geometric abstraction. This painting’s title calls out the 1962 print Foot Medication, reimagined as a monumental painting at upper left.
