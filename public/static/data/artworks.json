The artist used iron gall ink made from the protective growth an oak tree produces after a wasp lays its eggs inside the tree branch. The ink is deep brown and almost black in some areas. Because iron gall ink contains a high concentration of tannic acid, however, it dissolves paper over time. Above the right foot of the Roma woman the damaged paper was repaired.</p>\n<p>On several occasions De Gheyn represented figures from the Roma or Romani community, itinerant members of Dutch society whose origins can be traced to northern India.

The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and ﬂower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery reﬂection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eugène the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot’s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.</p>\n","dimensions":"60.3 × 80.4 cm (23 3/4 × 31 5/8 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":80.4,"width_in":31.625,"height_cm":60.3,"height_in":23.75,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Inscribed lower left: Berthe Morisot","credit_line":"Stickney Fund","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"W.

As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat—a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture—is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas’s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist’s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.</p>\n","dimensions":"100 × 110.7 cm (39 3/8 × 43 9/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":110.7,"width_in":43.5625,"height_cm":100,"height_in":39.375,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":null,"credit_line":"Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Daniel Catton Rich, “Bequest of Mrs. L.

While his work often exhibits influences of the contemporary movements he encountered in France and Germany, his subjects and decorative lyricism reveal his love of Russian folk art and his roots in Hasidic Judaism.</p>\n<p>In his 1931 autobiography, <em>My Life</em>, Chagall related how, while visiting Vitebsk (present-day Belarus), the city in which he was born, he realized that the traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. He paid a man to pose in his father’s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall’s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism.</p>\n<p>Chagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute’s <em>Praying Jew</em> is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I. This prompted him to make two versions of <em>The Praying Jew</em> before it left his studio: they are the present work and another in the Ca’ Pesaro, Venice; the original is now in the Kunstmuseum, Basel. The later compositions differ from the original only in small details.</p>\n","dimensions":"116.8 × 89.4 cm (46 × 35 3/16 in.)","dimensions_detail":[{"depth_cm":0,"depth_in":0,"width_cm":89.4,"width_in":35.1875,"height_cm":116.8,"height_in":46,"diameter_cm":0,"diameter_in":0,"clarification":null}],"medium_display":"Oil on canvas","inscriptions":"Signed, l.r.: \"MArc / ChAgAll\"","credit_line":"Joseph Winterbotham Collection","catalogue_display":null,"publication_history":"Bulletin de l’Effort Moderne 2 (February 1924), n.p.
